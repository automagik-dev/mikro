/**
 * run-task.mjs — drive one mined parity task through the real MCP path.
 *
 * Same shape as scripts/smoke-explore.mjs: an MCP SDK client over
 * `node dist/src/cli.js mcp --dir <task root>`, calling `rlmx_explore` with the
 * task's verbatim question. The difference is the install root — the recipe
 * goes into a scratch HOME's `~/.rlmx/agents/explore/` (discovery root #1,
 * src/mcp/agents.ts:56-68) rather than into the task repo, because the task
 * repos are the user's other checkouts and the gate must not write in them.
 * No `RLMX_AGENTS_DIR` override by default: the discovery path stays the real
 * one. (Gate extension: a caller-provided `RLMX_AGENTS_DIR` in the
 * environment is honored and replaces the default roots entirely — used by
 * the rlmx-v2-prime-backend gate, wish decision D5.)
 *
 *   node run-task.mjs <taskNumber> <model> <roundLabel>
 *        [--tasks-dir <dir>] [--recipe <dir>] [--agent <name>]
 *        [--out-dir <dir>] [--pin-child-model]
 *
 * Writes the verbatim result to parity/runs/<round>/task-<n>.json.
 *
 * **Every flag defaults to what this script did before the flag existed.** An
 * invocation with none of them drives `examples/agents/explore/` through
 * `rlmx_explore` against `<wish>/tasks/`, writes to `parity/runs/<round>/`, and
 * puts no `settings.json` in the scratch HOME — i.e. the frozen gate is
 * reproduced by the same command line it always used. The flags exist so
 * round 2's optimizer can drive a *different* recipe over a *different* suite
 * into a *different* output tree without a second copy of this driver drifting
 * away from it (round2/run-train-round.mjs is that caller).
 *
 * `--tasks-dir` defaults to the frozen eval suite, `<wish>/tasks`. It exists
 * because round 2 has a second suite — `parity/round2/train-tasks/`, the
 * training input the optimizer selects on — and without an argument the runner
 * could only ever drive the frozen six. Two consequences worth stating:
 *
 *   - The round label is the only thing separating one suite's runs from
 *     another's under `parity/runs/`. Use a label that names the suite, and
 *     read `record.tasksDir` (recorded on every run) if you have to tell them
 *     apart after the fact.
 *   - **Pointing this at the frozen suite is the only way to produce a gate
 *     number.** A training-suite run is a training-suite run; nothing about
 *     this flag makes the two comparable, and the train tasks carry no native
 *     arm to compare against (see round2/train-tasks/README.md).
 *
 * `--recipe` is what lets a second recipe be driven at all. `--agent` names the
 * directory it is installed into, and the tool called is `rlmx_<agent>` — the
 * MCP server derives the tool name from the agent directory (src/mcp/agents.ts),
 * so the two cannot be chosen independently.
 *
 * `--pin-child-model` writes `~/.rlmx/settings.json` into the scratch HOME
 * pinning `model.provider` / `model.model` / `model.sub-call-model` to `<model>`.
 * Since 6ec4822 a recursive child is pinned by `--model` on its own argv
 * (src/llm.ts:464, src/cli.ts:328-335), so this is belt-and-braces: it only
 * decides anything if a child is ever spawned without that flag, which is
 * exactly the silent-empty-answer failure of round 1 (recursion-recon.md §2.2).
 * It is off by default because the frozen gate ran without it.
