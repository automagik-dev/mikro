## Summary

Make rlmx's recursive multi-agent execution **observable**. Bump pi-ai `0.77.0`→latest (Models
runtime), then **instrument the recursion path to emit a real event stream** (today `RecurseEvent`
has no producer and `rlmLoop` never touches the emitter). The event stream is the shared substrate
consumed downstream by the `rlmx-acp` adapter (web client) and pi's native TUI — this wish builds
the substrate, not a renderer. The pi-ai bump also unblocks `extract-200-percent`'s `station`
provider, so this lands first.

## Scope

### IN

- **pi-ai bump → Models runtime**: move the two runtime imports (`completeSimple`, `getModel`) off
  the root — 0.80.0 relocated them to `/compat` — by migrating `src/llm.ts:8` and
  `src/sdk/rlm-driver.ts:62-65` to `builtinModels()`/`createModels()`. All `import type` unchanged.
- **Recursion instrumentation**: add the `RecurseEvent` producer at the `rlmQuery` spawn site; wire
  `rlm.ts::rlmLoop` to a `createEmitter()` bus; bridge child-process outcomes to the parent stream.
- **Adoptions**: `uuidv7()` (replace `randomUUID()` at `llm.ts:478`), `contentText()`, and surface
  `Usage.reasoning`/`AssistantMessage.responseModel` into metrics.
- **Headless subscriber** (`scripts/watch-headless.mjs`) — the reference consumer that proves the
  stream and is the terminal validation gate (no renderer in this wish).

### OUT

- **Any renderer / TUI / web UI** — the custom pi-tui view is dropped; viewing is the `rlmx-acp`
  adapter's + pi native TUI's job. This wish ships events, not pixels. Don't reinvent the wheel.
- **Level-2 child-internal live streaming** (child's own iterations animated live via `src/ipc.ts`) — enhancement.
- **Rewriting the recursion mechanism** — instrument the child-process model, don't replace it.
- **The `station` provider / metric microagents** — that's `extract-200-percent`.
- **Replacing `rlmLoop` with `runAgent`** — instrument the existing loop in place.

## Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Bump via **Models runtime** migration, not `/compat` band-aid | `/compat` is slated for removal; Models exposes `createProvider` the sibling wish needs. |
| 2 | **Instrument the recursion path** (RecurseEvent producer + rlmLoop→emitter) is the whole deliverable | The event types exist but have no producers; consumers can't render what isn't emitted. |
| 3 | Child nodes carry **final** usage via `onChildEnd`/`RlmChildResult.usage`; parent iterations via `IterationOutputEvent.metrics` | Children run in separate processes; two distinct channels. |
| 4 | Event ancestry keys on **`correlationId`/`RLMX_PARENT_RUN_ID`**, not `depth` | Depth can't disambiguate sibling branches; downstream consumers build the tree from this. |
| 5 | **No renderer in this wish** — a headless subscriber is the consumer proof | Viewing is `rlmx-acp` + pi native TUI; don't reinvent the wheel (user decision). |

## Dependencies

**depends-on:** none
**blocks:** extract-200-percent, rlmx-acp-adapter

## Success Criteria

- [ ] pi-ai pin is latest; `npm run check` + `npm run build` + `npm test` pass; a **recursive `rlmx` run still completes** (regression).
- [ ] A real recursive run **emits `RecurseEvent`** and drives the emitter — the **headless subscriber** logs one node per spawn.
- [ ] Event ancestry is correct across sibling branches — the subscriber reconstructs the tree by `correlationId` (not depth), with per-node tokens/cost/latency/toolCalls (parent from `IterationOutputEvent.metrics`, child from bridged `RlmChildResult.usage`).
- [ ] `uuidv7` ancestry IDs in use; `contentText` adopted; `responseModel`/`reasoning` present on the emitted events.
- [ ] `npm test` incl. `tests/sdk-events.test.ts` (event-contract gate) passes with the new producer.
- [ ] Docs: the event schema + how a consumer subscribes; note `rlmx-acp` + pi native TUI as the renderers.

## Execution Strategy

### Wave 1 (sequential) — pi-ai bump, independent and unblocking

| Group | Agent | Complexity | Model | Description |
|-------|-------|------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | engineer | 3 (multi-site provider/auth migration +2, no deterministic test +1) | engineer-standard / high | pi-ai → Models runtime; migrate the 2 imports; adopt contentText/responseModel/reasoning |

### Wave 2 (sequential) — instrumentation, gated by the headless subscriber

| Group | Agent | Complexity | Model | Description |
|-------|-------|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2 | engineer | 6 (stateful hot-path +2, agent-lifecycle/recursion +2, no deterministic test +1, prior-effort alignment +1) | engineer-complex / high | RecurseEvent producer + rlmLoop→emitter + child-result bridge + uuidv7 + headless subscriber |

## Execution Groups

### Group 1: pi-ai bump → Models runtime

**Goal:** rlmx runs on latest pi-ai via the durable Models API, with `createProvider` available.

**Deliverables:**
1. Bump `@earendil-works/pi-ai` to latest in `package.json`; `npm ci`.
2. Migrate `src/llm.ts:8` and `src/sdk/rlm-driver.ts:62-65` from root `completeSimple`/`getModel`
   to `builtinModels()`/`createModels()` (types unchanged).
3. Adopt `contentText()` for message-text joins; surface `Usage.reasoning`/`AssistantMessage.responseModel` in `UsageStats`/metrics.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `npm run check` (`tsc --noEmit`), `npm run build`, and **`npm test`** all pass (incl.
      `tests/sdk-events.test.ts`, the event-contract gate).
- [ ] A recursive `rlmx` query completes end-to-end (no behavior regression).

**Validation:**
```bash
cd ~/prod/rlmx && npm ci && npm run check && npm run build && npm test
```

**depends-on:** none

---

### Group 2: recursion instrumentation (emit the events)

**Goal:** a real recursive run emits an observable event stream over `createEmitter()`, proven headlessly.

**Deliverables:**
1. A **`RecurseEvent` producer** at the `llm.ts::rlmQuery` spawn site (currently zero producers).
2. Wire `rlm.ts::rlmLoop` to a `createEmitter()` bus so the parent's own iterations
   (`IterationStart/Output`, `ToolCallBefore/After`, `Session*`) are emitted live. **Expose the seam
   as opts injection** — `rlmLoop(query, context, config, { emitter })` accepts a caller-created
   emitter (so a caller can subscribe *before* the run); the headless subscriber and the `rlmx-acp`
   adapter both consume this exact signature. Default to an internal emitter when none is passed.
3. **Child-result bridge:** on `onChildEnd`, emit a child-completion event carrying `RlmChildResult.usage`
   plus `isError`/`durationMs` from the callback wrapper; tag events with `correlationId`/`RLMX_PARENT_RUN_ID`.
4. Replace `randomUUID()` (`llm.ts:478`) with `uuidv7()` for sortable ancestry IDs.
5. A **headless subscriber** (`scripts/watch-headless.mjs`) that logs the event stream, **one compact
   JSON line per event** (so the `type` field is greppable), and can reconstruct the tree by `correlationId`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Reusing the existing `events.ts` types/`makeEvent` (no schema fork), a ≥2-level recursive run
      emits one `RecurseEvent` per spawn; **`npm test` (incl. `sdk-events.test.ts`) still passes**.
- [ ] The headless subscriber prints a node per spawn and reconstructs correct `correlationId` ancestry across sibling branches.
- [ ] Group 1's recursive-run regression still passes (control flow unchanged; emits are additive).

**Validation:**
```bash
cd ~/prod/rlmx && npm run build && npm test && \
node scripts/watch-headless.mjs -- '<a-recursive-prompt>' | grep -c '"type":"Recurse"'
```

**depends-on:** 1

---

## QA Criteria

_What must be verified on dev after merge._

- [ ] Functional: the headless subscriber shows a correct event stream for a real recursive run.
- [ ] Integration: pi-ai bump + instrumentation compose; a normal `rlmx` run is unchanged; the stream is subscribable by an external consumer (proves the `rlmx-acp` seam).
- [ ] Regression: existing rlmx CLI subcommands, CAG mode, and Langfuse spans still work.

## Assumptions / Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Instrumentation touches the hot recursion path (`rlm.ts`/`llm.ts`) | High | Emits are synchronous/in-memory and additive; gate each step with the Group 1 recursive-run regression; never change control flow. |
| Cross-wish: `extract-200-percent` Group 1 needs 0.80's `createProvider` | High | This wish's Group 1 lands the bump first; `blocks: extract-200-percent`. |
| Completes the dormant SDK-events effort ("Wish B" per `emitter.ts`) — schema could diverge | Medium | Reuse `events.ts` types/`makeEvent` verbatim; only add the missing producer + wiring. |
| Child nodes carry only final usage (internal iterations run in the child process) | Medium | Bridge `onChildEnd`/`RlmChildResult.usage`; Level 2 (live child-internal via IPC) documented as next. |
| `IterationOutputEvent.metrics`/`costUsd`/`tokens` are optional (MetricsRecorder-gated) | Medium | Wire the recorder on the recursion path; criteria assert metrics populated. |
| Downstream consumers (`rlmx-acp`, pi TUI) not built here — risk of an unexercised event schema | Medium | The headless subscriber exercises the full schema (tree reconstruction) as the acceptance gate. |

## Review Results

### Plan review — 2026-07-20 — **SHIP** → Status APPROVED (superseded by amendment)

- **Reviewer:** reviewer (independent plan gate, Opus 4.8). SHIP after one FIX-FIRST round (pi-tui
  dependency + `npm test` gate + polish). Design provenance: design review BLOCKED the original
  "TUI is a free rendering layer" thesis → rewritten so instrumentation is the load-bearing scope → SHIP.

### Scope amendment — 2026-07-20 — Group 3 removed, **re-review pending**

- **Change:** dropped the custom pi-tui recursion view (former Group 3) and its `@earendil-works/pi-tui`
  dependency per user decision ("use pi native TUI + don't reinvent the wheel"). Viewing moves to the
  `rlmx-acp` adapter (web client) + pi native TUI. Wish now = bump + instrumentation only; the headless
  subscriber becomes the terminal acceptance gate. `blocks` now includes `rlmx-acp-adapter`. Appetite
  reduced large→medium.
- **Re-review — 2026-07-20 — SHIP → Status re-APPROVED.** Independent reviewer confirmed the reduction
  is a clean, coherent, executable scope cut: Groups 1-2 unchanged from their approved form; Group 2
  re-anchored on the headless subscriber (tree reconstruction by `correlationId`); pi-tui/`src/tui`
  fully removed (no dangling refs); `blocks` edges correct; validation realistic. Non-blocking nit:
  DESIGN.md still lists the TUI (left as-is — it's digest-stamped; editing invalidates its review
  evidence, and "wish narrows below design" is legitimate).
- **Coordination clarification — 2026-07-20.** During `rlmx-acp-adapter` plan review, the emitter seam
  was pinned to **opts injection** (`rlmLoop(..., { emitter })`) in both wishes (was "opts or returned
  stream"). Group 2 deliverable #2 now specifies this caller-facing signature so the ACP adapter and the
  headless subscriber consume the same API. Implementation-detail narrowing within the approved scope; no re-review needed.

_Execution and PR review evidence appended below as they occur._

### Execution review — Group 1 (pi-ai bump → Models runtime) — 2026-07-20 — **SHIP**

- **Engineer:** engineer-standard (Opus 4.8/high) — commit `4ffd7d0` on `wish/rlmx-live-tui`. Bumped
  `@earendil-works/pi-ai` 0.77.0→**0.80.10** (exact pin); migrated `src/llm.ts` + `src/sdk/rlm-driver.ts`
  off root `completeSimple`/`getModel` to `builtinModels()` (`.getModel()`/`.completeSimple()`); surfaced
  `Usage.reasoning` → optional `UsageStats.reasoningTokens` (threaded through createUsage/usageDelta/mergeUsage)
  and `AssistantMessage.responseModel` → `LLMResponse` + `llm_call` JSONL metric.
- **Acceptance review:** independent reviewer (Opus 4.8/high) — **SHIP**, first pass, no fix loops. All
  deliverables verified on disk + by live command runs; root imports confirmed gone (no `/compat` refs);
  `createProvider` confirmed still exported from pi-ai root (extract-200-percent dependency satisfied).
- **Quality review:** independent reviewer (Opus 4.8/high) — **SHIP**. Migration improves type safety;
  no secrets, no any-casts, no dead code, no hot-path perf regressions.
- **Orchestrator validation gate:** `npm ci && npm run check && npm run build && npm test` → **PASS**
  (377/377 tests incl. `tests/sdk-events.test.ts`).
- **Deviations/residuals:**
  1. `contentText()` **does not exist** in pi-ai 0.80.10 (verified against shipped `.d.ts` + package
     source by engineer and independently by reviewer) — the "adopt contentText()" deliverable item is
     void; the manual `textParts.join("")` in `llm.ts` is retained. Wish assumption disproven, not a defect.
  2. Live recursive-run regression exercised **to the LLM boundary only** — no provider credentials in
     env (`rlmx doctor`: all keys unset). Deferred to post-merge QA: run one live recursive query with
     real credentials.

### Execution review — Group 2 (recursion instrumentation) — 2026-07-20 — **SHIP**

- **Engineer:** engineer-complex (Opus 4.8/high) — commit `e29c094`. First `RecurseEvent` producer via new
  `src/sdk/recursion-bridge.ts` fed by the existing `onChildStart`/`onChildEnd` hooks at the `rlmQuery`
  spawn site (composed alongside the Langfuse recorder, not replacing it); contractual seam
  `rlmLoop(query, context, config, { emitter })` with internal-emitter default; child-completion bridged
  onto `IterationOutputEvent.metrics` (+`Error(phase:"recurse")` on failure) with `correlationId`/
  `RLMX_PARENT_RUN_ID` ancestry; dependency-free RFC 9562 `uuidv7()` in `src/uuid.ts`; headless
  subscriber `scripts/watch-headless.mjs` (STUB + `RLMX_HEADLESS_REAL=1` modes); README event-schema docs.
  No schema fork — additive optional `BaseEvent.correlationId`/`parentRunId`, `responseModel`/`reasoning`.
- **Acceptance review:** independent reviewer (Opus 4.8/high) — **SHIP** first pass. Minors recorded (below).
- **Quality review:** independent reviewer (Opus 4.8/high) — **FIX-FIRST** with 2 major gaps → fixer
  (Opus 4.8/high) resolved both in commit `1b1923e` → re-review **SHIP**:
  1. Emitter lifecycle: a throw in rlmLoop's setup region escaped without `SessionClose`/`close()`,
     hanging a pre-subscribed consumer's `for-await` forever. Fixed with a setup try/catch that emits
     `Error` + `closeEmitter('error')` then rethrows; regression test `tests/rlm-setup-failure.test.ts`.
  2. Unbounded pre-subscribe backlog in `createEmitter()` — capped at `PRE_SUBSCRIBE_BUFFER_LIMIT=256`;
     regression test added; emit-then-close-then-iterate contract preserved.
- **Orchestrator validation gate:** `npm run build && npm test` → **PASS (384/384)**;
  `node scripts/watch-headless.mjs -- '<prompt>' | grep -c '"type":"Recurse"'` → **4** (one per spawn),
  tree reconstruction correct across sibling branches at two levels (root→A,B; A→A1,A2), per-node
  cost/tokens/latency populated.
- **Residual minors (accepted, tracked for QA/follow-up):**
  1. Deterministic proof drives `createRecursionBridge` directly; the `rlmLoop → onChildStart → bridge`
     wiring in `rlm.ts` is verified by static inspection, not an executed test.
  2. `llm.ts` spawn-**error** path (`child.on('error')`, i.e. spawn itself fails) calls `onChildEnd`
     without `correlationId`/`depth`, mis-attributing that completion to the parent node — edge case;
     the normal nonzero-exit path is correct.
  3. Live real recursive run still deferred to QA-with-credentials (no keys, no local endpoint;
     `RLMX_HEADLESS_REAL=1 node scripts/watch-headless.mjs -- "<prompt>"` is the QA command).

### Final gate — 2026-07-20 — **SHIP** (Fable 5, adversarial aggregate review)

- **Cross-wish Contract A (extract-200-percent):** `createProvider` verified as a live root export of the
  installed pi-ai 0.80.10 — SATISFIED.
- **Cross-wish Contract B (rlmx-acp-adapter):** external-consumer proof against `dist/` — imported
  `rlmLoop` + `sdk.createEmitter`, subscribed **before** run, forced a setup failure:
  pre-first-iteration events delivered live, stream terminated (`AgentStart, SessionOpen, Error,
  SessionClose`), emitter closed, error rethrown. The 256 pre-subscribe cap does not touch subscribed
  consumers; emit-then-close-then-iterate holds. All `rlmLoop` return paths close the emitter — SATISFIED.
- **Composition:** no-emitter callers behavior-identical; `process._getActiveHandles()` empty after a
  run (no leaked timers/handles); gates re-run green (384/384).
- **New findings (both minor, no observable consumer today; fix before rlmx-acp Level-2 work):**
  1. `src/llm.ts:621` — `child.on("error")` spawn-failure path omits `correlationId`/`depth` (both in
     scope), so the bridge mis-attributes that completion to the parent node. One-line fix.
  2. `src/rlm.ts:435` — mid-tree ancestry env mismatch: children are spawned with
     `parentRunId: logger.runId` instead of `selfCorrelationId`, so at depth ≥ 1 a grandchild's
     self-tagged `parentRunId` points at an id no other stream knows. Recurse *edges* stay correct.
     Fix: pass `parentRunId: selfCorrelationId`.
- **QA notes:** in REAL mode the root stream carries Recurse edges for *direct* children only (Level-2
  aggregation is out of scope) — expected, not a regression. The rlmx-acp adapter should own a
  truncation/redaction policy at the web boundary (`ToolCallBefore.args` / `ToolCallAfter.result` are
  untruncated; Error events carry stack traces; no secrets in event payloads).
