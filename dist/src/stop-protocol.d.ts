/**
 * The termination protocol every FINAL-terminated run needs in its system
 * prompt.
 *
 * Why this module exists: a pack's own `SYSTEM.md` *replaces* the scaffolded
 * template rather than extending it — both `buildSystemPrompt` (`src/rlm.ts`)
 * and `buildCachedSystemPrompt` (`src/cache.ts`) start from `config.system`
 * verbatim. The ```repl``` fence contract and the `FINAL()` / `FINAL_VAR()`
 * contract lived *only* in `src/templates/default/SYSTEM.md`, so an agent that
 * shipped a hand-written prompt was never told how to stop: it emitted prose,
 * `detectFinal` never fired, and the run burned to `max_iterations`.
 *
 * The text below is authored for the runtime rather than copied from the
 * template — templates stay untouched, and the two are free to diverge in
 * voice.
 *
 * Deliberately absent, unlike the template: `SHOW_VARS()`. This section is
 * appended to *every* custom prompt, so it stays a minimal termination
 * contract — how to run code, how to stop, and the one ordering mistake that
 * breaks stopping. `SHOW_VARS()` is a debugging convenience rather than part
 * of terminating, and enumerating REPL helpers here would compete with
 * whatever inventory the pack's own prompt already gives. (It is bound at
 * every tool level — `python/repl_server.py` — so this is an editorial choice,
 * not an availability one.)
 *
 * Consumers must go through `appendStopProtocol` so the dedupe and opt-out
 * rules stay in one place.

export declare const STOP_PROTOCOL_SECTION = "## REPL & Final Answer Protocol\n\nTo run Python in the REPL environment, wrap the code in triple backticks with the `repl` language identifier. For example:\n```repl\nchunk = context[:10000]\nanswer = llm_query(f\"What is the magic number in the context? Here is the chunk: {chunk}\")\nprint(answer)\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: When the iterative process is done, you MUST deliver your final answer inside a FINAL function \u2014 not as ordinary prose, and not inside a code block. You have two options:\n1. `FINAL(your final answer here)` returns the answer directly.\n2. `FINAL_VAR(variable_name)` returns a variable you already built in the REPL as your final output.\n\nWARNING \u2014 COMMON MISTAKE: `FINAL_VAR` retrieves an EXISTING variable. Create and assign that variable in a ```repl``` block FIRST, then call `FINAL_VAR` in a SEPARATE later step.\n\nOn iteration 0 you have not touched the REPL or seen your context yet, so investigate first \u2014 do not answer with FINAL straight away.";

 * Whether `config` wants the protocol appended.

 * Two ways to get `false`:
 * - `prompt.append-stop-protocol: false` (mikro.yaml, or an agent.yaml
 *   override applied by `applyAgent`) — an explicit opt-out.
 * - `config.system` already contains `FINAL(` — the pack teaches the protocol
 *   itself, which is true of both shipped templates.
 *
 * An absent or empty `config.system` (zero-config runs included) gets the bare
 * section. That is intended: an empty system prompt otherwise leaves the model
 * with no way to terminate at all.
