/**
 * `rlmx mcp` — expose rlmx to MCP clients (Claude Code, Codex, …).
 *
 * Why this exists: ACP's *client* is an editor and its *agent* is the AI tool,
 * so `rlmx acp` is an Agent — and Claude Code and Codex are Agents too. Two
 * agents cannot drive each other over ACP. MCP is the protocol those harnesses
 * *do* speak as clients, which makes it the native way to hand rlmx work.
 *
 *   claude mcp add rlmx -- rlmx mcp
 *
 * Every discovered `agent.yaml` microagent becomes its own tool, so the host
 * model sees `rlmx_test_writer` / `rlmx_triage` as distinct capabilities it
 * can delegate to, rather than one opaque escape hatch it has to be told how
 * to use. Each tool runs on whatever model its `agent.yaml` names — a local
 * `station/<model>` or a cheap cloud model — which is how repeatable work gets
 * moved off an expensive host model.
 *
 * Every result carries its own token/cost footer, so the offload is visible in
 * the transcript as it happens instead of having to be taken on faith.
 *
 * Two properties make this usable rather than merely present:
 *
 *   Live tool set — every `tools/list` AND every `tools/call` re-scans the
 *   agent roots, and both the advertised list and the dispatch table are built
 *   from that one scan. An agent directory authored mid-session is therefore
 *   listed *and* callable without a reconnect, and the server emits
 *   `notifications/tools/list_changed` when the set actually changes.
 *
 *   Agent-tool isomorphism — the surface mirrors the host's own Agent tool:
 *   `prompt` in, one final report out, a `session_id` to continue with. A
 *   follow-up resumes by replaying the session's bounded turn history into the
 *   new prompt (the mechanism `src/acp/agent.ts` uses); the Python REPL is
 *   rebuilt per call and its state is deliberately not promised across turns.
 *
 * stdout discipline: MCP stdio frames JSON-RPC on stdout, so all human/
 * diagnostic logging is redirected to stderr and `rlmLoop` is run with
 * `output: "json"` to keep it off its stream-mode stdout path — the same
 * contract `src/acp/agent.ts` follows.

 * `scan` until every earlier refresh has finished updating the baseline. That
 * is the actual guarantee — not merely that the diff and the baseline update
 * share a synchronous step, but that scans cannot complete out of order. Two
 * concurrent requests observing one new agent therefore report the change
