/**
 * author-explore-tasks.mjs — build explore tasks that no transcript contains.
 *
 * `mine-explore-tasks.mjs` cuts tasks out of work somebody already did. That is
 * the right way to get an *eval* suite, and it is why the frozen suite was mined
 * rather than written. It has one failure mode, and this host hit it: the corpus
 * runs out. Measured on 2026-07-27 over 745 transcripts and every window up to
 * 720h (the whole corpus is 8 days old), the miner finds **8** explore-class
 * candidates, **7** of which stand on the same files in the same repo as a
 * frozen eval task and are dropped by the subject test. One survives. A training
 * suite of one is not a training suite, and lowering the significance screen
 * does not help — measured at `--min-read-ops 4/3/2/1`, the yield stays 1,
 * because what rejects the rest is the fact bar and the mutation bar, not the
 * screen.
 *
 * So the remainder is authored, and this script is the machinery that keeps
 * "authored" from meaning "asserted". A hand-written checklist is worth exactly
 * as much as its verification, so every fact here is put through a check that is
 * **stricter than the miner's**:
 *
 *   - the anchor `path:line` must exist under the task root;
 *   - the fact's term must be on the anchor line itself — no ±3 slack, no
 *     re-anchoring to where the term lives today, no falling back to another
 *     line the claim cites. The miner allows all three because a repo moves
 *     between a session and the mining run; an authored fact is written against
 *     the tree as it stands, so it gets none of them;
 *   - the term must be specific enough to point at a line — the miner's bound,
 *     unchanged: at most `MAX_ANCHOR_HITS` (8) occurrences in the file, or 5% of
 *     its lines, whichever is smaller;
 *   - the term must appear in the claim as written, so a reader sees the link
 *     between the sentence and the quoted line rather than taking it on trust;
 *   - the claim must be a claim: `MIN_CLAIM_CHARS`..`MAX_CLAIM_CHARS`, the
 *     miner's bounds;
 *   - the reference answer must pass criteria 2 and 3 itself — every `path:line`
 *     it writes about the root must resolve there — which is the same rejection
 *     the miner applies to a native answer before it will emit the task;
 *   - every fact's anchor must actually be cited in the reference answer, so the
 *     checklist is a checklist *of that answer* and not a wish list beside it.
 *
 * Anything that fails is refused, loudly, with the file and line it failed on.
 * The bar can only reject tasks; there is no path through this script that
 * writes a fact it could not verify.
 *
 * **Disjointness** is enforced by the same mechanism the miner uses and against
 * the same metadata: an excluded suite's task files are read for their *task
 * root, session id and anchor files only* — never their question text, never
 * their answer — and an authored task standing on ≥`--subject-overlap` of an
 * excluded task's anchor files in the same root is refused. The measured
 * overlap is recorded for every task, clash or not, so the disjointness claim
 * can be recomputed from both suites' checklists instead of believed.
 *
 * **What is honestly different from a mined task**, stated in each file it
 * writes and once more here:
 *
 *   - The question was written for this suite. It is not a verbatim transcript
 *     line, and the file says so in its heading rather than borrowing the
 *     miner's "verbatim from the transcript".
 *   - There is no native arm. A mined task's ground truth is a real session's
 *     answer, which is what makes the D6/P3 asymmetry conservative — native
 *     scores 100% by construction and the gate is therefore harder for rlmx.
 *     An authored task has no such session, so it carries **no native baseline
 *     and no native token accounting**, and `score-task.mjs --native` will not
 *     run against it. It is a training input, not a gate input.
 *   - The rubric is the frozen one, unchanged: ≥90% of required facts, all
 *     citations resolve, no fabrication.
 *
 *   node scripts/author-explore-tasks.mjs --spec <spec.json> --out <dir> \
 *     --exclude-tasks .genie/wishes/<wish>/tasks --run-json authored-run.json
 *   node scripts/author-explore-tasks.mjs --spec <spec.json> --dry-run
 *
 * Spec shape:
 *
 *   { "authoredBy": "…", "startAt": 2, "tasks": [ {
 *       "root": "/abs/path", "slug": "short-id", "question": "…",
 *       "answer": "…the reference answer, with path:line citations…",
 *       "fitness": true | false, "fitnessNote": "…why held out…",
 *       "facts": [ { "claim": "…", "anchor": "src/x.ts:42", "term": "ident",
 *                    "kind": "symbol" | "quote" } ] } ] }
 *
 * `fitness` (default true) is the optimizer-selection flag, and it exists
 * because "the task is valid" and "the task is a usable training signal" are
 * different questions. A task authored about the same tree, and off the same
 * investigation, that produced the prompt being tuned is still a correct task —
 * every fact is machine-verified — but selecting on it closes a loop: the
 * ground truth and the candidate prompt share an author and a reading of the
 * code. Such a task is written, verified and kept as a held-out diagnostic, and
 * `fitness: false` says so in the task file's own header and in the run record,
 * so an optimizer harness can honour it mechanically instead of a README asking
 * a human to remember.
