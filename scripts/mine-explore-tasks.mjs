/**
 * mine-explore-tasks.mjs — build the explore parity suite out of real work.
 *
 * The parity gate is only worth running on tasks somebody actually needed
 * answered. Synthetic questions are written to be answerable, which is exactly
 * the bias that would make a cheap model look like it reached parity. So this
 * script reads this host's own Claude Code transcripts (`~/.claude/projects`)
 * and lifts out the explore-class work: a question, a run of read-only
 * searching and reading, and the answer that came back.
 *
 * What makes a transcript segment explore-class here:
 *
 *   - it starts with a human question (not a slash command, not a hook or
 *     tool-result echo),
 *   - it asks where something lives or why it behaves that way — not for a
 *     verdict: a plan/design/PR review is read-only too, but a verdict is not
 *     a citation, and the wish scopes this suite to explore-class work,
 *   - it mutates nothing — no Edit/Write, no mutating shell, no delegated
 *     subagent whose work happened where this script cannot see it,
 *   - it does real searching and reading (Grep/Read/Glob plus read-only Bash),
 *   - and it ends in a substantive answer.
 *
 * **What becomes a required fact.** Only a `path:line` citation the native
 * answer made about the task root, whose surrounding sentence says something,
 * and whose own words are still findable in that file today. "Its own words"
 * is the whole of the verification, and it is deliberately narrow: the *term*
 * that links a claim to a line is either a code identifier the claim names or a
 * fragment it quotes, and it must be **specific enough to point at a line** —
 * a token smeared over a tenth of the file (`STAGE` in a build script, `config`
 * in a loader) corroborates nothing, so a claim that can only be anchored on
 * one of those is dropped rather than decorated with an evidence line that is
 * evidence for nothing. Every emitted fact names the term it was anchored on,
 * so the link between claim and quoted line is auditable rather than asserted.
 *
 * Resolution is content-anchored rather than line-number-anchored: a repo moves
 * between the session and the mining run, so a claim whose code slid down the
 * file is re-anchored to where it lives now (with the drift recorded), and one
 * whose terms are gone is excluded under its own heading. Anchoring on the
 * stale number instead would penalise the arm that cites the *current* line
 * correctly, which is the opposite of what the rubric is for. Drift is only
 * recorded when there really was drift: a sentence that cites `:34` and
 * `:139-144` in one breath is anchored at whichever of *its own* lines carries
 * the term, and that is not a repo that moved.
 *
 * Four things are deliberately **not** facts, because none of them is a
 * checkable statement about the answer:
 *
 *   - a bare path with no line ("file exists, 527 lines") — true of the file,
 *     silent about the claim, and equally true for an arm that never read it;
 *   - an identifier looked up somewhere in the tree — "this word appears in
 *     some file" pairs an arbitrary line with whatever sentence first mentioned
 *     the word, which is how a heading ends up "verified" against a test
 *     fixture;
 *   - a claim with nothing checkable in it. "Line 139 is not blank" is a fact
 *     about the file's whitespace; it says nothing about whether the answer was
 *     right, and a claim whose sentence names no identifier and quotes no
 *     fragment cannot be scored consistently by either arm's scorer;
 *   - a claim about a sibling tree. The rlmx arm sees one directory
 *     (`rlmx mcp --dir`), so a claim outside it is structurally unanswerable.
 *     Those citations are resolved and listed under their own heading —
 *     reporting them as "path not found" would read as native having been
 *     wrong when it was simply talking about somewhere else — but they are out
 *     of scope for both arms.
 *
 * Those verified facts — and only those — become the required-facts checklist.
 * This is the deliberately conservative asymmetry the design calls out (D6/P3):
 * ground truth comes from the native arm, so native scores 100% by
 * construction, which makes the gate harder for rlmx and can never manufacture
 * a false pass. That construction is *checked*, not assumed: a task whose own
 * native answer fails criterion 2 or 3 (a citation into the task root that does
 * not resolve, or a `path:line` no listed tree has) is not emitted, because a
 * suite where the ground-truth arm fails the rubric cannot be scored honestly.
 *
 * Window: the past 24h, widened when 24h does not yield enough significant
 * tasks (the wish's stated fallback for a quiet day). Every attempt is recorded
 * in `mining-run.json`, so a reader can audit that the widening was earned
 * rather than chosen. Real tasks only, either way.
 *
 * Secrets: transcripts contain whatever was typed at them, so every verbatim
 * string is redacted on the way out (API keys, bearer tokens, JWTs, private
 * keys, `KEY=value` pairs). Redaction is applied to the text that gets written,
 * not to the text that gets matched, so a redacted secret can never resolve
 * into a "fact".
